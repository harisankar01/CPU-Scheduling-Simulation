# CPU Scheduling Simulation
  CPU use may algorithms such as 
  + First Come First Served(FCFS)
  + Shortest Job First(SJF)
  + Round robin

  These are used to schedule which process or task must be done **first** when many 
process are waiting. In this project I have created a simulation of these three algorithms to understand them more easier.
  
# Requirements
  **Pygame** a popular game library in pyton is used in this project to create simulation of the scheduling process
  
Just clone the repositor and install pygame with pip. Then run the main file
```
pip install pygame
```

```
python3 main.py
```
